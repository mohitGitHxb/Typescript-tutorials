Welcome to the Typescript Tutorials repository! This repository is designed to help you understand and learn TypeScript in a simple and intuitive way.

## About TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript which adds optional static typing. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.


## Getting Started

To get started with these tutorials, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have those, you can install TypeScript globally on your machine by running:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
